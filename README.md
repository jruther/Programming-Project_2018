# Programming-Project_2018
## An analysis of the Iris Data Set for the project submission for Programming & Scripting Course 2018

 
## Preface
This repository is submitted by Justin Rutherford for grading to Dr. Ian McLoughlin as the project part of the module on Programming and Scripting from the course in Higher Diploma in Data Analytics at GMIT.  The module commenced in January 2018 and this submission dated 28.4.18 completes it.
The project requirements are as follows;
1.	Research and investigate the Fisher’s Iris data set .
2.	Use Python code to perform the investigation and analysis.
3.	Summarise the analysis with a report presented in a Readme.md file in the repository.
4.	Include supporting tables and graphics as required.
5.	Reference material accordingly, and uphold the GMIT Quality Assurance Framework .

## The Iris Data Set
### Introduction and Background
Fisher’s Iris Data Set is arguably the most widely know database primarily used as learning material in the field of pattern recognition, machine learning and data analytics.
The data set was formulated by a British statistician and biologist, Ronald Fisher and published in his paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems, in 1936.  The actual data was collected by Edgar Anderson, along the shore of the Saint Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada.
The data set consists of 150 samples of three species of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).  Each species has 50 samples.  Each flower was measured for four features namely, sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.  The measurement is in centimetres (cm’s).  Based on the features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant analysis model to distinguish the species from each other. 

### The Investigative Process
1.	The data set was downloaded from the following address; https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
2.	The data set as saved as a CSV file in a local folder which as then uploaded and synchronised  to the current repository (https://github.com/jruther/Programming-Project_2018).
3.	A new folder was opened in Visual Studio Code to run the analysis using python code.
4.	A link was established to the repository to upload saved commits as the analysis progressed.
5.	The NumPy package was imported to perform the fundamental analysis.
6.	The Seaborn package was imported to provide a visualisation of the data.
7.	The Pandas package was imported to run machine learning code and perform data analysis and visualisation of results.



















Data Set Information:

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. (Source https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
