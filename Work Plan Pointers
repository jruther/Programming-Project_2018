# Advice from Ian McLoughlin 20.4.18 

Research

You might consider further developing the following in future submissions:

- Try to provide clear evidence that you developed new knowledge and skills while completing the assignment.

- Make sure to search online for various approaches to the problem, including other people's attempts at solving a similar problem. 

- Summarise the results of this search in the project documentation. 

- Make it clear why you adopted the approach you did, comparing it to the other approaches.

 

Development

You might consider further developing the following in future submissions:

- Consider your findings from researching the problem and use them to develop a plan for the project. 

- A good plan will be evident in the layout and organisation of your code.

- Demonstrate how you made sure your software or project did what you said it would do at the start. 

- For instance, you might consider devising some small tests that demonstrate that your submission provides the right outputs.

 

Consistency

You might consider further developing the following in future submissions:

- You should draw up a plan for completing an assignment and make the plan evident in your submission. 

- You should try to stick to this plan, and your project timeline should clearly demonstrate your work towards it.

 

Documentation

You might consider further developing the following in future submissions:

- Consider various audiences when documenting your work. 

-A technical audience, such as a lecturer, will require one style of description while a non-technical audience, such as a recruiter, will require another. 

- Unfortunately, most of the time your work needs to speak to both.
